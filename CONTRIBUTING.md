# Contributing to Engram

*This is built in the open. Early contributors shape what it becomes — and become part of it.*

</div>

---

## Five-Minute Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Engram.git
cd Engram

# 2. Install
./install.sh          # macOS / Linux
# or: pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 3. Run the MCP server locally
python -m engram.cli serve --http

# 4. Open the local dashboard
# http://127.0.0.1:7474/dashboard

# 5. Ask your agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to set up Engram
# Your agent will call engram_init and you'll see it working.

# 5. Make a change → open a PR
git checkout -b your-feature-or-fix
```

That's it. If any step fails, open an issue — a broken setup path is itself a valid first contribution.

## Good First Contributions

Not sure where to start? These are always useful:
- **Improve error messages** — vague errors are bugs
- **Add test coverage** for an edge case you noticed
- **Document a non-obvious behavior** in a code comment or the README
- **Pick a roadmap item** from [README.md#roadmap](./README.md#roadmap) — comment on the issue before starting so we can align

---

## Before You Start

Read the [README](./README.md). Understand the problem Engram is solving. The best contributions come from people who've felt the pain — agents re-discovering things that were already known, knowledge evaporating at session end.

If something is unclear or the design raises questions, **open a discussion before writing code.** Early-stage projects benefit more from alignment than from PRs that go in a different direction.

<br />

## Ways to Contribute

### Open a Discussion
The design is still being shaped. If you have thoughts on the API surface, the storage model, the conflict detection approach, or anything else — open a GitHub Discussion and share them. That is a real contribution.

### File an Issue
Found a bug, a gap in the design, or something that doesn't make sense? Open an issue. Be specific. Include what you expected, what happened, and what context matters.

### Submit a Pull Request
Code contributions are welcome. See the workflow below.

<br />

## Development Workflow

**1. Fork and clone**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Engram.git
cd Engram
```

**2. Create a branch**
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-or-fix
```

Use a descriptive branch name. `fix/conflict-detection-threshold` is better than `fix`.

**3. Make your changes**

Keep changes focused. One concern per PR. If you find yourself touching unrelated things, split them out.

**4. Test your work**

Don't submit a PR you haven't run yourself. If tests don't exist yet for what you're changing, add them or note it clearly in the PR description.

**5. Open a PR**

Write a clear description:
- What does this change?
- Why is it the right change?
- Is there anything the reviewer should pay particular attention to?

<br />

## What Good PRs Look Like

- **Focused.** One change, one reason.
- **Explained.** The description covers the why, not just the what.
- **Clean.** No dead code, no commented-out experiments, no unrelated formatting changes.
- **Tested.** Ideally with new tests. At minimum, not breaking existing ones.

<br />

## What to Avoid

- PRs without context or explanation
- Large refactors without prior discussion
- Changes to core API surface without an issue or discussion first
- Dependency additions without a clear reason

If you're unsure whether something is in scope, ask first. The cost of a quick discussion is much lower than a PR that can't be merged.

<br />

## Code Style

Consistency matters more than any particular style. Match what's already there. If you're introducing something new, be deliberate about it and note it in the PR.

<br />

## Roadmap Items

The [README roadmap](./README.md#roadmap) lists what's being built. These are good starting points if you want to contribute but aren't sure where. Comment on an issue or open a discussion before picking one up — some items have design decisions that need to happen first.

<br />

## Ground Rules

- Be direct and specific in issues and reviews. Be respectful.
- Disagreement on approach is fine. Resolve it through discussion, not pressure.
- If you commit to something, follow through. If you can't, say so early.

<br />

## Questions

Not sure where to start? Open a discussion. Describe what you're thinking, what interests you, or what problem you've run into. That's enough to start a conversation.

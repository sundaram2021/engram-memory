# Engram

**Shared memory for your team's AI agents**

Every agent on the team sees the same verified facts. When agents contradict each other, Engram catches it before it becomes a bug.

## How It Works

When your team works in the same codebase, your AI agents work in parallel — and drift apart. One agent learns something, another learns something different, and now they disagree. Engram detects that and surfaces it before it becomes a bug.

Every agent's messages are automatically committed to shared memory as facts. No manual step. No copy-pasting context between sessions. The team's collective knowledge accumulates and every agent benefits from it instantly.

## Getting Started

### If you're setting up Engram for your team

You do this once. Your teammates don't need to install anything.

**Step 1 — Create a workspace**

Go to [engram-memory.com/dashboard](https://engram-memory.com/dashboard), sign in, and create a new workspace. You'll get an invite link to share with your team.

**Step 2 — Run the installer**

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://engram-memory.com/install | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://engram-memory.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows (CMD):**
```cmd
curl -fsSL https://engram-memory.com/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

This configures your IDE and installs the auto-commit hook. Restart your editor when it's done.

**Step 3 — Ask your agent to connect**

```
"Set up Engram for my team"
```

Your agent connects to shared memory and writes a `.engram.env` file to your repo. Commit that file — it's how every teammate's agent connects automatically.

### If you're joining a teammate's workspace

**Step 1 — Install Engram**

Run the same installer as above for your OS. This configures your IDE and installs the auto-commit hook.

**Step 2 — Accept the invite**

Click the invite link your teammate shared, sign in at [engram-memory.com](https://engram-memory.com), and accept the workspace invite. This writes your invite key to `.engram.env` in the repo.

When you open the codebase, your agent reads that file and connects automatically.

> Your agent's messages will be recorded as facts in the shared workspace — this is what Engram does. You agreed to this when you accepted the invite. Leave the workspace at any time from the dashboard.

---

## What Gets Committed

Every message you send to your AI agent is recorded in shared team memory as a fact. The agent's responses are not stored — only your inputs. This gives every agent on the team a running record of what was asked, decided, and discovered.

Facts accumulate. The next time any agent on the team opens this codebase — yours, your teammate's, anyone with workspace access — they start with the full context of everything that's been verified.

---

## Conflict Detection

Every commit triggers conflict detection across the full fact corpus. When two agents have recorded contradictory facts, Engram surfaces the contradiction on the dashboard before either agent acts on stale information.

Engram reads the workspace's commit history as a chronological story and asks: *where would a new agent get confused about what's currently true?* It catches reversals and ambiguity that simple pairwise comparison misses.

## Privacy & Data

- **Isolated per workspace.** Your data is never mixed with other workspaces.
- **Encrypted in transit and at rest.**
- **Never used for training.** Your facts are never read, analyzed, or shared with anyone outside your workspace.
- **Right to erasure.** Delete your workspace and every fact is gone. GDPR-compliant erasure is built into the core engine.

---

## IDE Support

Engram works with any AI coding environment. First-class support for:

- [Claude Code](./docs/quickstart/claude-code.md)
- [Cursor](./docs/quickstart/cursor.md)
- [Windsurf / Kiro](./docs/quickstart/windsurf.md)
- [VS Code (Copilot)](./docs/quickstart/vscode-copilot.md)
- [Zed](./docs/quickstart/zed.md)

Agents without MCP support connect via the REST API using the credentials in `.engram.env`. Instructions are in `AGENTS.md` at the root of every Engram-enabled repo.

## CLI Reference

```bash
engram install          # Configure your IDE and install the auto-commit hook
engram verify           # Check that everything is connected
engram search <query>   # Query workspace memory from the terminal
engram import <path>    # Bulk-ingest Markdown/text docs
engram diff --from <time> --to <time>  # Show memory changes over a time window
engram tail             # Live stream of commits as they happen
engram serve --http     # Run the MCP server locally (port 7474)
```

---

## Self-Hosting

Engram runs on any Postgres database. Point it at your own instance and your facts never leave your infrastructure.

```bash
export ENGRAM_DB_URL='postgres://user:password@host:port/database'
engram serve --http
```

## Research Foundation

Engram is built on a body of research that reframes multi-agent memory as a computer architecture problem — coherence, consistency, and shared state across concurrent agents.

- **[Yu et al. (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.10062)** — Primary intellectual foundation. Multi-agent memory from a computer architecture perspective.
- **[Xu et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110)** — A-Mem's Zettelkasten structure for fact enrichment
- **[Rasmussen et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956)** — Graphiti's bitemporal modeling for temporal validity
- **[Hu et al. (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13564)** — Survey confirming shared memory as an open frontier

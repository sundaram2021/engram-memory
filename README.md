# Engram

**Shared memory for your team's agents**

Persistent memory that survives across sessions and detects when agents contradict each other.

## What It Does

When one agent discovers something important — a hidden side effect, a failed approach, an undocumented constraint — it commits that fact. Every other agent on your team can query it instantly.

When two agents develop incompatible beliefs, Engram detects the contradiction and surfaces it for review.

**Your data is private.** All data is encrypted, isolated by workspace, and never read, analyzed, or redistributed. We have a deep commitment to privacy.

---

## Quick Start

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://engram-memory.com/install | sh
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
irm https://engram-memory.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**
```cmd
curl -fsSL https://engram-memory.com/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

By default, the installer writes `https://mcp.engram.app/mcp` into your MCP config. If your environment needs a different endpoint, set `ENGRAM_MCP_URL` before running the installer.

Restart your editor, then ask your agent:
```
"Set up Engram for my team"
```

Your agent handles the rest.

## First-Class IDE Targets

Engram is currently optimized for MCP-native workflows in:

- [Claude Code](./docs/quickstart/claude-code.md)
- [VS Code (Copilot)](./docs/quickstart/vscode-copilot.md)
- [Windsurf](./docs/quickstart/windsurf.md)
- [Zed](./docs/quickstart/zed.md)

Each guide includes the expected MCP config path, restart step, verification flow, and common setup mistakes.


## Running Locally

If you want to run Engram from this repository during development:

```powershell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m engram.cli serve --http
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7474/dashboard
```

If `engram` is not on your `PATH`, `python -m engram.cli ...` works reliably.

## Setup Flow

### Creating a Workspace

> 🤖 **Agent**
>
> Do you have an Invite Key to join an existing workspace, or are you setting up a new one?

> 👤 **You**
>
> New

> 🤖 **Agent**
>
> ✅ Your team workspace is ready.
>
> Share this Invite Key with teammates:
> ```
> ek_live_abc123...
> ```
>
> That's all they need — one key, nothing else to configure.
>
> Should commits show who made them, or stay anonymous?

### Joining a Workspace

> 🤖 **Agent**
>
> Do you have an Invite Key to join an existing workspace, or are you setting up a new one?

> 👤 **You**
>
> Join — here's my key: `ek_live_abc123...`

> 🤖 **Agent**
>
> You're in. I'll query team memory before starting work on anything.

**That's it.** Teammates only need the Invite Key. No database URL, no Team ID, no configuration.

No database to provision, no servers to run, no ports to open. Install and go.

## Privacy & Security

Your memory is yours. This isn't a footnote — it's the foundation Engram is built on.

**Encrypted.** All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. Invite keys use encrypted payloads so teammates never see raw credentials.

**Isolated.** Every workspace is fully isolated. There is no cross-workspace access, no shared tables, no data leakage between teams.

**Never read.** We don't read your facts. We don't analyze your memory. We don't train on your data. We don't sell it. We have no analytics pipeline that touches your content. Period.

**Never redistributed.** Your team's knowledge never leaves your workspace. It is never shared with other users, other teams, or third parties. Not now, not ever.

**You control it.** Delete your workspace and everything is gone. Anonymous mode strips engineer names from all commits. Anonymous agents randomize agent IDs each session. You decide what's visible and what isn't.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `engram_commit` | Persist a verified discovery |
| `engram_query` | Pull what your team's agents know |
| `engram_conflicts` | Surface contradictions |
| `engram_resolve` | Settle disagreements |
| `engram_promote` | Graduate ephemeral memory to durable |

### CLI Commands

```bash
engram install              # Auto-detect IDEs and configure MCP
engram serve               # Start MCP server (stdio mode)
engram serve --http        # Start MCP server (HTTP mode)
engram setup              # One-command workspace setup
engram status             # Show workspace status
engram info               # Display detailed workspace info
engram whoami             # Show current user identity
engram search <query>     # Query workspace from terminal
engram stats              # Show workspace statistics
engram config show        # Display configuration
engram config set <key>   # Update configuration
engram tail               # Live stream of workspace commits
engram verify             # Verify installation
engram doctor             # Diagnose setup issues
engram completion <shell> # Install shell tab completion
```

## Conflict Detection

Runs asynchronously in the background:

| Tier | Method | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Entity matching | "rate limit is 1000" vs "rate limit is 2000" |
| 1 | NLI cross-encoder | Semantic contradictions |
| 2 | Numeric rules | Different values for same entity |
| 3 | LLM escalation | Ambiguous cases (rare, optional) |

Commits return instantly. Detection completes in the background (~2-10s on CPU).

## Memory That Forgets on Purpose

Engram doesn't just accumulate — it actively forgets what doesn't earn its place.

- **Ephemeral memory** — Scratchpad facts auto-expire in 24h unless queried twice ("proved useful more than once")
- **Importance decay** — Unverified inferences expire after 30 days. Unverified observations expire after 90 days.
- **Protected facts** — Decisions, verified facts, and corroborated claims are never auto-retired.
- **Steeper recency curve** — A 90-day-old fact scores 0.001 in retrieval. Old context stops crowding out what matters now.

Grounded in the [FiFA/MaRS research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12856) on forgetting-by-design for cognitive agents.

## Research Foundation

Engram exists because of a paper.

**[Multi-Agent Memory from a Computer Architecture Perspective: Visions and Challenges Ahead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.10062)** — Yu et al. (2026), UCSD SysEvol — is the primary intellectual foundation of this project. It reframes multi-agent memory as a computer architecture problem: coherence, consistency, and shared state across concurrent agents. That framing is what Engram is built to implement in practice.

The rest of the literature informs specific subsystems:

- **[Xu et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110)** — A-Mem's Zettelkasten structure for fact enrichment
- **[Rasmussen et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956)** — Graphiti's bitemporal modeling for temporal validity
- **[Hu et al. (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13564)** — Survey confirming shared memory as an open frontier
- **[Alqithami (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12856)** — FiFA: forgetting-by-design improves agent coherence

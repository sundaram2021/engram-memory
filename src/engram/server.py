"""Engram MCP Server.

Eight tools total:
  engram_status           — check setup state; guides agent through onboarding
  engram_init             — founder creates a new workspace (requires ENGRAM_DB_URL)
  engram_join             — teammate joins an existing workspace via Invite Key
  engram_reset_invite_key — creator resets the invite key after a security breach
  engram_commit           — write a verified fact to shared memory
  engram_query            — read what the team's agents collectively know
  engram_conflicts        — surface contradictions between facts
  engram_resolve          — settle a disagreement

Tool descriptions embed behavioral guidance for the LLM.
The 'next_prompt' field in onboarding responses tells the agent exactly what to say.

    Only call this if you're the workspace founder. Teammates should use engram_join.

    The invite key contains the database URL encrypted inside it —
    teammates only need the Team ID and Invite Key (not the db URL).

    Parameters:
    - anonymous_mode: If true, engineer names are stripped from all commits.

    **Common mistake:** Forgetting to share the new invite key with team members after
    resetting, leaving them unable to reconnect.

    Use this when you suspect a security breach or the current invite key

      1. Revoke all existing invite keys for your workspace.
      2. Increment the workspace key generation counter.

    """Commit a claim about the codebase to shared team memory.

    **Precondition:** Call engram_status first to ensure workspace is ready.

    **When to call:**
    - After discovering something worth preserving (side effects, failures, constraints)
    - When making architectural decisions
    - After tests reveal behavior not documented elsewhere

    **What NOT to do:**
    - Don't commit speculative claims — only verified discoveries
    - Don't commit secrets, API keys, or credentials (will be rejected)
    - Don't call more than 5 times per task; batch related facts

    **Common mistake:** Forgetting to commit discoveries, leaving the next
    agent to re-discover the same information.

    Use this when your agent discovers something worth preserving:
    a hidden side effect, a failed approach, an undocumented constraint,
    an architectural decision, or a configuration detail.

    IMPORTANT: Do not commit speculative or uncertain claims. Only commit
    facts your agent has verified through code reading, testing, or
    direct observation. Set confidence below 0.5 for uncertain claims.

    IMPORTANT: Do not include secrets, API keys, passwords, or credentials
    in the content field. The server will reject commits containing
    detected secrets.

    IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 5 times per task. Batch
    related discoveries into a single, well-structured claim.

    Parameters:
    - content: The claim in plain English. Be specific. Include service
      names, version numbers, config keys, and numeric values where
      relevant. BAD: "auth is broken". GOOD: "The auth service
      rate-limits to 1000 req/s per IP using a sliding window in Redis,
      configured via AUTH_RATE_LIMIT in .env".
    - scope: Hierarchical topic path. Defaults to "general". Examples:
      "auth", "payments/webhooks", "infra/docker". Use consistent scopes
      across your team.
    - confidence: 0.0-1.0. Defaults to 0.8. How certain is this claim?
      1.0 = verified in code. 0.7 = observed behavior. 0.3 = inferred
      from context.
    - agent_id: Your agent identifier. Use your agent name for attribution
      (e.g. the name field from your AgentConfig when using open-multi-agent).
      Auto-generated if omitted.
    - engineer: Optional human identifier (email or username) of the engineer
      whose agent is making this commit. Used for team attribution and trust
      scoring. Example: "alice@example.com" or your GitHub username.
    - corrects_lineage: If this claim corrects a previous one, pass the
      lineage_id of the claim being corrected. The old claim will be
      marked as superseded.
    - provenance: Optional evidence trail. File path, line number, test
      output, or tool call ID that generated this evidence. Facts with
      provenance are marked as verified in query results.
    - fact_type: "observation" (directly observed in code/tests/logs),
      "inference" (concluded from observations), or "decision"
      (architectural decision by humans or agents). Default: observation.
    - ttl_days: Optional time-to-live in days. When set, the fact
      automatically expires after this period. Useful for facts about
      external dependencies, API contracts, or infrastructure that
      change frequently. Default: null (no expiry).
    - operation: Memory CRUD intent. One of:
        "add"    (default) — new independent fact.
        "update" — supersede an outdated fact. If corrects_lineage is
                   omitted, the engine automatically finds the most
                   semantically similar active fact in scope and supersedes
                   it (no lineage tracking required from the caller).
        "delete" — retire an existing fact without replacement; requires
                   corrects_lineage (the lineage_id to close).
        "none"   — no-op; signals the agent has nothing new to add.
    - durability: Memory tier. One of:
        "durable"   (default) — persistent fact. Included in queries by
                     default. Triggers conflict detection. Use for verified
                     discoveries that the team should know about.
        "ephemeral" — scratchpad memory. Excluded from queries unless
                     include_ephemeral=true is passed. Skips conflict
                     detection. Auto-expires after ttl_days (default 1 day).
                     Automatically promoted to durable when queried at least
                     twice. Use for in-progress observations, hypotheses,
                     or context that hasn't proven its value yet.

    Returns: {fact_id, committed_at, duplicate, conflicts_detected,
              memory_op, supersedes_fact_id, durability, suggestions}

    Example: {"fact_id": "fact_xyz789", "committed_at": "2026-04-10T15:30:00Z", "duplicate": false, "conflicts_detected": 0}

    **Precondition:** Call engram_status first to ensure workspace is ready.

    **When to call:**
    - BEFORE starting any task or feature work
    - When you encounter an error and need context
    - Before making architectural decisions

    **What NOT to do:**
    - Don't call this AFTER you've already started working — you wasted context
    - Don't make multiple broad queries; be specific with your topic
    - Don't treat disputed claims (has_open_conflict=true) as settled facts

    **Common mistake:** Starting work without engram_query, then rediscovering
    what another agent already documented.

    Parameters:
    - topic: What you want to know about. Be specific. BAD: "auth".
      GOOD: "How does the auth service handle JWT token refresh?"
    - scope: Optional filter. "auth" returns claims in "auth" and all
      sub-scopes like "auth/jwt", "auth/oauth".
    - limit: Max results (default 10, max 50).
    - as_of: ISO 8601 timestamp for historical queries. Returns what
      the system knew at that point in time.
    - fact_type: Optional filter. "observation", "inference", or
      "decision". Omit to return all types.
    - agent_id: Your agent identifier. Used for read permission checks
      when the server runs in auth mode (--auth flag). Match the same
      agent_id you use when calling engram_commit.
    - include_ephemeral: When true, includes ephemeral (scratchpad) facts
      alongside durable facts. Ephemeral facts are short-lived observations
      that haven't proven their value yet. They rank lower than durable
      facts. Ephemeral facts that appear in query results are tracked;
      once queried twice they are automatically promoted to durable.
      Default: false.
    - include_adjacent: When true and a scope is provided, also searches
      sibling and parent scopes for semantically related facts. Adjacent
      results are marked with adjacent=true and include their original_scope
      so you can distinguish in-scope from related knowledge. Useful when
      a query might benefit from cross-cutting context. Default: false.

    so explicit promotion is only needed when you want to fast-track a
    fact you know is valuable immediately.

    Example workflow:
    1. Query with include_ephemeral=true to find relevant ephemeral facts
    2. Review the facts and determine which are valuable enough to promote
    3. Call engram_promote with the fact_id of each valuable fact

    Parameters:
    - fact_id: The ID of the ephemeral fact to promote. Get this from
      query results (include_ephemeral=true returns fact_id for each fact).

    Returns: {promoted: true, fact_id, durability: "durable"}
